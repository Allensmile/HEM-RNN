**Repeat Copy**
(in progress)

**Associative Recall**
(in progress)

**Dynamic N-Grams**
(in progress)

**Priority Sort**
(in progress)


## Usage
To train a copy task:
```
    $ python main.py
```


## Future works
- Training HEM-RNN to learning *repeat copy*.
- Training HEM-RNN to learning *associative recall*.
- Training HEM-RNN to learning *dynamical n-grams*.
- Training HEM-RNN to learning *priority sort*.
- Using HEM-RNN for other natural language processing tasks such as neural language model.
